# Data_Analysis_Project
OBJECTIVES

The project's major goal was to design and build a dynamic KPI dashboard using Power BI that would allow the executive team to get insights into critical parts of Northwind Traders' operations. The dashboard emphasized the following critical areas:

Sales Trends: An in-depth examination of sales performance over time, including revenue trends, sales growth, and comparisons to previous periods. These insights would allow management to assess the company's financial health, recognize developing patterns, and make strategic decisions based on them.

Product Performance: Provides an in-depth look into the performance of several gourmet food products supplied by Northwind Traders. The dashboard emphasized top-selling products, product category trends, and profitability analyses, making it easier to manage product portfolios and discover chances for improvement.

Key Customer: Identifying and profiling Northwind Traders' most valued customers, allowing the executive team to better understand consumer preferences, evaluate purchase trends, and develop strategies to improve customer happiness and retention. Customer revenue contribution, order frequency, and customer segmentation were all supplied by the dashboard.

Shipping Costs: Assessing the influence of shipping costs on the company's profitability. The dashboard exhibited shipping cost trends, comparisons of different delivery methods, and high-cost shipping regions. These insights aided in the optimization of logistics and the reduction of operational costs.
